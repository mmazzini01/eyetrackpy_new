# prompt_response_eyetrackpy

A Python library that utilizes and extends the data processor models from the [eyetrackpy](https://github.com/angelalopezcardona/eyetrackpy) library by Angela Lopez Cardona. This library applies these models to analyze eye-tracking data in Visual Question Answering (VQA) experiments, specifically for processing both prompts and responses.

## Features

- Uses eyetrackpy's data processor models for fixation analysis
- Processes fixations for both prompts and responses
- Generates visualization plots for prompt-response patterns
- Compatible with existing eyetrackpy workflows

## Installation

You can install the library directly from GitHub using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mmazzini01/prompt_response_eyetrackpy.git
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the  in example\data_processor directory after installing:

```python
python main_prompt_response.py
